## ðŸ”µ **Blue Teaming: Basics**

**Blue Teaming** refers to the **defensive side of cybersecurity**, where the main goal is to **detect, respond to, and prevent cyber threats**.

---

## ðŸ§  **Core Concepts**

### 1. **Defense-in-Depth**

* A layered security approach.
* If one control fails, others still provide protection.
* Examples: firewall + antivirus + endpoint detection + logging.

### 2. **Security Monitoring**

* Watching systems for signs of malicious activity.
* Use of tools like **SIEM** (e.g., Splunk, ELK Stack).

### 3. **Incident Response (IR)**

* The process of identifying, managing, and recovering from cyber incidents.
* Phases: **Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned**.

### 4. **Threat Hunting**

* Proactively looking for threats that evaded detection.
* Uses threat intelligence and behavioral analysis.

### 5. **Vulnerability Management**

* Identifying, evaluating, and fixing vulnerabilities.
* Tools: Nessus, OpenVAS, Qualys.

### 6. **Log Analysis**

* Reviewing logs (from firewalls, servers, etc.) to detect unusual activity.

### 7. **Patch Management**

* Keeping software updated to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

### 8. **Network Security**

* Securing the network through:

  * Firewalls
  * IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)
  * VLANs
  * Segmentation

### 9. **Endpoint Protection**

* Protecting individual devices (laptops, servers, etc.).
* Tools: EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response), Antivirus.

### 10. **Security Policies and Procedures**

* Written guidelines to manage how systems and data are protected.
* Includes Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs), Incident Response Plans, etc.
